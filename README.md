## bugs:
* ~~hamburger hitbox~~
I fixed it by adding  "pointer-events: none;" on everything getting above the toggler checkbox ( class: "header__icon--menuwrap--hamburger")

* ~~footer width right, icons out of page~~
i fixed it by fixing HTML markup and getting rid of useless divs

* ~~footer list collapsing on small screen~~
i fixed it by settingup a list wrapper, displaying it as a table and then each lists as a table cell with 'display: " ";' ( class:"footer__listwrap" & "footer__list" )

* footer going through main content
